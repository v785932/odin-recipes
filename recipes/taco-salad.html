        <h2 class="desc1">Description</h2>
        <p class="desc2">This is a quick-to-throw-together taco salad that even picky family members will eat, as you can serve any of the ingredients on the side.</p>
        <p class="desc2">I sometimes serve with taco shells and let my five-year-old make tacos out of the ingredients (minus the dressing for the salad). Serve salad with tortilla chips, avocado, cilantro, and Cheddar cheese to taste. Yum!</p>
        
        <h3 class="desc1">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingr">
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>¾ cup water</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix</li>
            <li>1 head romaine lettuce, chopped</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) basket grape tomatoes, chopped</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped carrots, or to taste</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped green bell pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste (Optional)</li>
            <li>¼ cup lime juice</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="desc1">Steps</h3>
        <ol class="ingr">
            <li class="steps">Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add water and taco seasoning mix; cook and stir until water is evaporated and beef is evenly coated in seasoning mix, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li class="steps">Mix romaine lettuce, kidney beans, tomatoes, avocado, carrots, green bell pepper, celery, and Cheddar cheese in a large bowl; top with ground beef.</li>
            <li class="steps">Whisk lime juice, honey, vinegar, cilantro, mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until dressing is well mixed; served alongside salad.</li>
